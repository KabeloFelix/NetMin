Forge130.exe is an executable file associated with Sound Forge Pro 13, a digital audio editing software developed by Magix Software GmbH, designed for professionals and enthusiasts in audio production. This specific version, 13.0.0.124, is generally considered safe to use if it is obtained from the official Magix website or legitimate sources, as it is part of a well-known audio editing suite. However, like many executable files, it can be flagged by antivirus programs if they detect unusual behavior or if the file is corrupted, potentially leading to errors such as application crashes or failure to launch. Users may encounter issues like high CPU usage or conflicts with other software, but these are often resolvable through updates or reinstallation. To ensure safety, it is advisable to keep antivirus software up to date and to verify the legitimacy of the download source.
